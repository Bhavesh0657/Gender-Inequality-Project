# Gender-Inequality-Project
# Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze gender inequality and its relationship with socioeconomic factors worldwide. Using Python's Pandas for data manipulation and Flourish for visualizations, it investigates how gender inequality intersects with key indicators across countries. By leveraging the Gender Inequality Index (GII) from the UNDP, the project explores disparities in health, education, and economic opportunities to uncover insights into global gender gaps and their effects on human development.

# Steps of the Project:
## Data Preparation:
1. Collect data from Kaggle.
2. Utilize Pandas in Python for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.
## Visualization:
1. Import data into Flourish for visualization of key trends and patterns.
2. Publish visualizations to Canva for presentation.
## Presentation:
1. Craft a Canva presentation.
2. Add voiceover to elucidate visualizations and highlight key insights for clarity and engagement.

# Key Inferences from the Data:
## 1. Countries with Good HDI:
Found in North America, Europe, North Asia Subcontinent, and Australia.
## 2. Factors Influencing Low HDI:
High Gender Inequality Index (GII).
## 3. Major Factors Influencing GII:
Female empowerment, including health and education.
Female labor force participation.
Political representation of women.
## 4. Female Empowerment and Health:
Influenced by factors such as adolescent birth rates and maternal mortality rates.
## 5. Impact of Education:
Higher female secondary education linked to decreased adolescent births and maternal mortality rates.
## 6. Female Labor Force and Political Representation:
